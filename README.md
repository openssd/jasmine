The OpenSSD Project Source Code Repository

The OpenSSD Project is an initiative to promote research and education on the recent SSD (Solid State Drive) technology by providing easy access to ''OpenSSD platforms'' on which open source SSD firmware can be developed. Currently, we offer an OpenSSD platform based on the commercially successful Barefoot<sup>TM</sup> controller from Indilinx Co., Ltd. For further information, please refer to the OpenSSD Project website at [http://www.openssd-project.org/](http://www.openssd-project.org/)
